      <p>
      Hello, my name is Pankaj Doley, and I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) in my 3rd semester at Assam down town University. I have a strong interest in technology and web development. Recently, I've been working on a project focused on creating an e-commerce website for Mising Handloom and Textile products, where I'm involved in building features like account management and shopping cart functionality. I am passionate about learning new programming languages and enhancing my skills in areas like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the future, I aim to explore more advanced fields like Hacking ,cyber security and mobile application development.
